Learned how to write text input between separate text boxes

This took me a while to figure out since I had to rewrite the code two times. Basically this will be used as a reference for future projects. In this test you can input text into two seperate boxes, have multiple lines and remove text with the backspace key. Pretty simple. Is there anything I could've done better?
